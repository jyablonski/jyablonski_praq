# Rust
[Guide](https://datawithrust.com/)
Rust is a systems programming language that acts as a memory safe and performant alternative to to C++.  It was started in 2006 and 1.0 was released in 2015.  It's still a new language by programming standards and is gaining more and more traction over time.

How it works is you write code that is compiled into machine code and then executed, using the Rust Compiler + LLVM.  The code generated by this process is platform or OS independent.  The Rust Compiler converts the code we type into machine code (LLVM) before it actually runs.

Compiled languages do have some downsides, including:
- Build Times.  Compilation is an additional step in the process of developing software applications.
- Verbosity.  Statically typed languages increases the time it takes for developer to write code.
- Flexibility.  Changing anything requires a re-compilation and relinking before being able to run the code again.

Rust is statically typed, so you must type all of your variables as you code so that they're known at compile time.  Python is a dynamically language which doesn't enforce type safety.  The Python Interpreter checks every line one-by-one as it runs to figure out what the types are before executed it in the Python Virtual Machine.  This can lead to type issues at runtime.
- `python_random_fail.py`
- `rust_random_fail.rs`
- The Python file will sometimes run and sometimes fail, the Rust file fails at compilation and immediately spits out an error before a programmer can ever run the code.

Ownership means that any given value has one owner for its lifetime.  The owner is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory occupied by that value for its lifetime.  This is helpful to know for memory leaks.

Borrowing makes it posible to pass around references for values without changing or transferring its ownership.  Think of this like an alias to the contents of a value.  Different parts of the program can use these values without requiring a copy step.  
- Borrowing can be done in a mutable (changing the value) or immutable (not changing the value) way
- Only one mutable borrow of a value can be active at a time.
- Ownership is temporarily given up during borrowing.
- Like if you gave your friend your console and then that friend lets other people play on the console while he has it.

These concepts help prevent data races by enforcing strict rules over shared resources.  This is important when dealing with concurrent programs.  Rust has built in support for safe concurrencyt without the mess which is good for data-intensive tasks.

``` rs
rustc hello_world.rs
./hello_world

// format code like for black
rustup component add rustfmt
cargo fmt
rustfmt hello_world.rs
```
