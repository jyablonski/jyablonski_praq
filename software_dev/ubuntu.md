# Ubuntu
Ubuntu is a popular and widely used open-source operating system based on the Linux kernel. It is known for its user-friendly interface, stability, and a strong focus on ease of use and accessibility. Ubuntu is developed and maintained by Canonical Ltd., a UK-based software company.

## Updates
When you run the following commands on Ubuntu:

1. `sudo apt update`
2. `sudo apt upgrade`

Here's what happens:

1. `sudo apt update`:
   - This command updates the package list on your Ubuntu system. It connects to the package repositories specified in your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file or in files under the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` directory.
   - The package list contains information about available packages and their versions.
   - Running this command ensures that your system is aware of the latest package versions and dependencies available from the repositories, but it doesn't install any updates. It's just an information update.

2. `sudo apt upgrade`:
   - This command upgrades the installed packages on your Ubuntu system to their latest available versions. It does this by comparing the package versions listed in the updated package list (which you obtained with `apt update`) with the currently installed package versions on your system.
   - If there are updated versions available for any installed packages, `apt upgrade` will prompt you to confirm whether you want to upgrade those packages.
   - If you confirm, it will download and install the updated packages, replacing the older versions with the new ones.
   - `sudo` is used to run this command with superuser (administrator) privileges because updating and upgrading packages may require administrative permissions.

In summary, `sudo apt update` refreshes the package information on your system, while `sudo apt upgrade` installs any available updates for the installed packages. It's a good practice to run `apt update` before `apt upgrade` to ensure your system is aware of the latest package versions.
