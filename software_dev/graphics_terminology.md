# Graphics Terminology

### DirectX

**DirectX** is a collection of APIs developed by Microsoft for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. It includes various APIs such as Direct3D for graphics, DirectSound for audio, and DirectInput for input.

- **Relevance to Linux**: DirectX is native to Windows, which means games developed for Windows typically use DirectX. To run these games on Linux, translation layers or compatibility tools are required.

### Vulkan

**Vulkan** is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics and computing API developed by the Khronos Group. It provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones.

- **Relevance to Linux**: Vulkan is natively supported on Linux and is often used as the preferred graphics API for new games due to its performance benefits and cross-platform capabilities.

### DXVK

**DXVK** (DirectX to Vulkan) is a translation layer that converts Direct3D 9/10/11 calls to Vulkan. It is a critical component for running DirectX games on Linux.

- **Relevance to Linux**: DXVK is commonly used with Wine and Proton to run Windows games on Linux. It translates DirectX calls to Vulkan, leveraging the native support of Vulkan on Linux to improve performance and compatibility.

### Wine

**Wine** (Wine Is Not an Emulator) is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It translates Windows system calls into POSIX-compliant system calls, replicates Windows libraries, and provides a Windows-like environment on Linux.

- **Relevance to Linux**: Wine is essential for running many Windows applications and games on Linux. When combined with DXVK, it allows DirectX games to run efficiently on Linux by converting DirectX calls to Vulkan.

### Wayland

**Wayland** is a protocol that specifies the communication between a display server (compositor) and its clients. It is designed to be simpler and more modern than the older X Window System (X11).

- **Relevance to Linux**: Wayland is increasingly becoming the default display server protocol on many Linux distributions due to its simplicity and performance benefits. Gaming on Wayland is possible, but some compatibility issues remain as many games and applications are still primarily designed with X11 in mind.

### Connections and Context for a Linux Gaming User

For a Linux gamer, these technologies are interconnected as follows:

1. **Running Windows Games**: Many popular games are developed for Windows and use DirectX. To play these on Linux, gamers typically rely on Wine, which provides the necessary compatibility layer. However, to handle DirectX's graphics calls, Wine uses DXVK to translate these calls to Vulkan, enabling efficient execution on Linux.

2. **Native Linux Games**: Games developed for Linux often use Vulkan due to its cross-platform nature and performance advantages. These games can run natively on Linux without the need for translation layers.

3. **Display Servers**: Wayland is gradually replacing X11 as the default display server protocol on many Linux distributions. While this transition is ongoing, some games and applications may still rely on X11, either directly or through a compatibility layer like XWayland.

4. **Proton**: Developed by Valve, Proton is a tool integrated with Steam Play that allows Windows games to run on Linux. Proton incorporates both Wine and DXVK to provide a seamless experience for gamers, leveraging Vulkan for high performance.

### Practical Scenario for a Linux Gamer

- **Installing a Windows Game**: A Linux user installs a Windows game via Steam. Steam uses Proton, which combines Wine and DXVK, to run the game. DXVK translates the game's DirectX calls to Vulkan, allowing it to run efficiently on the Linux system.
- **Playing a Native Linux Game**: The user also plays a game developed for Linux using Vulkan. This game runs natively on the Linux system without needing any compatibility layers.
- **Display Server**: If the user is on a Wayland session, the game runs within the Wayland environment. If any application still requires X11, it runs via XWayland, ensuring compatibility.
