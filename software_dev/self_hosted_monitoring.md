# Self Hosted Monitoring

1. **Prometheus -> Thanos:**
   - **Prometheus** is a monitoring and alerting toolkit originally developed by SoundCloud, now a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping HTTP endpoints.
   - **Thanos** is an open-source project that adds long-term storage capabilities to Prometheus. It allows for seamless querying of historical data across multiple Prometheus servers and provides downsampling and retention policies.

2. **Vector ships logs to Quickwit:**
   - **Vector** is a high-performance, open-source observability data router. It can collect, transform, and route logs, metrics, and traces to various destinations.
   - **Quickwit** seems to be the destination for logs in this setup. Quickwit is an open-source search engine that provides fast and scalable full-text search capabilities. It can index and make logs searchable.

3. **Traces via Jaeger to Quickwit:**
   - **Jaeger** is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems.
   - Traces from Jaeger are also directed to Quickwit for storage and indexing, alongside logs from Vector.

4. **Grafana as the UI:**
   - **Grafana** is a popular open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and understand metrics from multiple sources, including Prometheus and Thanos.
   - Grafana serves as the user interface in your setup, providing a unified view for metrics, logs (via Quickwit), and traces.

### Simplified Flow:
- Prometheus collects metrics and sends them to Thanos for long-term storage and querying.
- Vector collects logs and sends them to Quickwit, which indexes them for fast search and retrieval.
- Jaeger collects traces and sends them to Quickwit alongside logs.
- Grafana serves as the dashboard for visualizing metrics, logs, and traces, leveraging data from Prometheus/Thanos and Quickwit.

This architecture allows for a self-hosted, scalable, and customizable observability stack, replacing the functionality previously provided by Datadog with open-source alternatives.


### Role of OpenTelemetry:

**1. Instrumentation:**
   - **OpenTelemetry** provides libraries for instrumenting your applications to generate distributed traces and metrics automatically. These libraries are available for various programming languages and frameworks.

**2. Tracing:**
   - With OpenTelemetry, your applications can generate distributed traces that capture the flow of requests across various microservices and components.

**3. Exporters:**
   - OpenTelemetry supports exporters that can send traces and metrics to various backends, including Jaeger (for tracing) and Prometheus (for metrics).

### Integration with the Existing Components:

**1. Traces:**
   - OpenTelemetry can export traces to Jaeger. These traces are then routed to Quickwit for storage and indexing, alongside logs from Vector.

**2. Metrics:**
   - OpenTelemetry can export metrics to Prometheus. Thanos can then handle long-term storage and querying of these metrics, providing scalability and retention policies.

**3. Visualization:**
   - Grafana can integrate with Prometheus for metrics visualization and with Quickwit for logs and traces (via Jaeger and potentially OpenTelemetry if you choose to use it for metrics as well).

### Flow with OpenTelemetry:

- **Instrumentation:** Applications are instrumented with OpenTelemetry to generate traces and metrics.
- **Tracing:** Traces generated by OpenTelemetry are exported to Jaeger.
- **Storage:** Jaeger exports traces to Quickwit, where they are indexed alongside logs from Vector.
- **Metrics:** Metrics generated by OpenTelemetry are exported to Prometheus.
- **Long-term Storage:** Prometheus metrics are stored and queried via Thanos for long-term storage needs.
- **Visualization:** Grafana serves as the UI to visualize metrics from Prometheus/Thanos and logs/traces from Quickwit/Jaeger.

### Benefits of OpenTelemetry:

- **Unified Observability:** OpenTelemetry provides a standardized way to collect and export traces and metrics, making it easier to integrate with various observability tools.
- **Automatic Instrumentation:** It simplifies the process of instrumenting applications, ensuring that traces and metrics are generated consistently across your environment.
- **Ecosystem Integration:** OpenTelemetry integrates well with existing observability components like Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana, enhancing the overall observability of your system.

By incorporating OpenTelemetry into your observability stack, you enhance the granularity and depth of your monitoring and tracing capabilities, facilitating better insights into the performance and behavior of your applications and infrastructure.
