DuckDB is an in-memory Database Management System to handle complex queries on large volumes of data.  It's known for its high performance and compatability with SQL.  It's a local OLAP Database on steroids.

DuckDB is typically hosted locally on a single machine.  It's basically a columnar-focused version of SQLite.
