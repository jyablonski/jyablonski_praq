# Guitar

## Components

- Body
  - The base of the Guitar which is typically made of wood
  - Different types of Wood are used such as Maple, Mahogany, Alder etc
- Neck
  - Fretboard - made of wood with metal frets embedded along its length
  - Headstock - end of the neck which has the tuning pegs for the strings
  - Truss Rod - the Metal Rod in the neck that maintains its shape and adjusts the tension to counteract the pull of the strings
- Bridge 
  - Fixed Bridge - Stationary and provides stable tuning
  - Tremolo Bridge - allows the player to bend the pitch of the strings with a whammy bar.
- Pickups
  - Pickups are critical components that convert string vibrations into electrical signals, which can then be amplified to produce a sound.
  - Single-coil - Known for their bright, clear sound. but prone to electromagnetic interference
  - Humbucker - Consists of two coils wired out of phase to cancel out noise and produce a thicker, warmer sound
  - Piezo - Uses  piezoelectric crystals to detect string vibrations in hybrid electric-acoustic guitars
  - Active - Includee an onboard preamp powered by a battery and produce a high powerful tone, but require battery changes.
- Electronics
  - Volume and Tone controls - Knobs that adjust the output level and tonal quality of the sound
  - Pickup Selector Switch - Allows the player to choose between different pickups or combinations of pickups
  - Output jack - Input for a cable to connect the Electric Guitar to an Amplifer of other audio equipment
- Tuners
  - Tuning Pegs - Located on the headstock to adjust tension and pitch of each string
  - Machine Heads - Actual mechanism in the tuning peg that holds the string tension and allows for fine tuning
- Strings
  - Electric Guitar STrings - typically steel or nickel and vary in thickness which affects sound and playability
- Nut
  - Small piece of hard material location at the junction of the headstock and fretboard to guide the strings from the tuners to the fretboard
- Pickguard
  - A plastic or laminate piece attached to the body to protect the finish from wear & tear from pick scratches
- Strap Buttons
  - Metal Knobs mounted on the body where the guitar strap is attached to allow the player to hold the guitar while standing

## Frets
A fret is a raised metal strip embedded along the neck of a guitar. Frets are placed at specific intervals, allowing the guitarist to change the pitch of the strings by pressing them down behind these metal strips.

- You press down on a string at a specific fret to play a note.
- When you press a string down behind a fret, you shorten the vibrating length of the string, raising its pitch. The pitch increases by one half-step for each successive fret.
- The small circles or dots in the middle of certain frets on the guitar neck are called fret markers or position markers. These are inlaid into the fretboard and serve as visual guides to help guitarists quickly identify specific frets and positions on the neck.
- The 1st Fret is located closest to the Headstock, and goes down from there.

When pressing down on a fret to play a note, you should press the string just behind the metal fret wire, not directly on it or in the middle of the fret.

- `|---| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |`
- This helps in producing a clear, buzz-free note. This also requires less finger pressure and effort from your end to reduce finger fatigue and improve playing efficiency
- Avoid pressing directly on top of the fret wire as this can mute the string or produce an unwanted buzzing sound.
- Pressing in the middle of the fret requires more effort and can lead to unclear notes or buzzing.

## Strings
Guitars typically have 6 Strings

- E (thickest)
- A
- D
- G
- B
- e (thinnest)

## Terminology

Fretting - using your left hand to press down on the strings at different frets to change the pitch

Strumming and picking - use your right hand to strum the strings with a pick or your fingers. Different strumming patterns produce different sounds.

Chords - a combination of 3 or more notes played simultaneously. Fundamenetal building block in music

Pedals effect distortion, reverb, and elay between the guitar and the amplifier to change the sound.

An octave is a musical interval that spans eight notes in a diatonic scale, where the first and eighth notes have the same name and the higher note has double the frequency of the lower note.

- Open Low E String (E2): The open sixth string.
- 12th Fret of the Low E String (E3): Playing the 12th fret on the low E string produces the E note one octave higher than the open string.

## Tuning

Standard Guitar Tuning is EADGBe

1. **6th String (Low E)**: The thickest string, produces an E note when played open.
2. **5th String (A)**: The second thickest string, produces an A note when played open.
3. **4th String (D)**: Produces a D note when played open.
4. **3rd String (G)**: Produces a G note when played open.
5. **2nd String (B)**: Produces a B note when played open.
6. **1st String (High e)**: The thinnest string, produces a high E note when played open.

- the `e` produces the note E, specifically the E note that is two octaves higher than the low E note produced by the sixth (thickest) string.

Drop B tuning is a type of guitar tuning that lowers the pitch of the strings, giving the guitar a heavier and darker tone, commonly used in genres like metal, hard rock, and grunge. In Drop B tuning, the strings are tuned as follows from lowest (6th string) to highest (1st string):

- **6th string**: B (two and a half steps down from E)
- **5th string**: F# (one and a half steps down from A)
- **4th string**: B (one and a half steps down from D)
- **3rd string**: E (one and a half steps down from G)
- **2nd string**: G# (one and a half steps down from B)
- **1st string**: C# (one and a half steps down from E)

In musical terms, a "step" refers to a whole step (two frets on the guitar), and a "half step" refers to a half step (one fret on the guitar).

The `#` symbol denotes a sharp, meaning the note is raised by one half step from its natural counterpart.

B Flat (Bb) means the note is played one half step lower than B. This is an enharmonic equivalent to A#, which is A played one half step higher. A# and Bb play the same note and sound the exact same.

- When you play different frets on the same string of a guitar, you're changing the pitch of the note produced. 
- For F# (F Sharp), that should be played one half step higher than F
- If you play the 1st Fret on the Low E String, that's an F. If you play it on the 2nd Fret, that's F#

### Steps to Tune to Drop B:
1. **Tune the 6th String**: Lower the E string down to B. This is achieved by tuning down five half steps (or a perfect fourth interval).
2. **Tune the 5th String**: Lower the A string down to F#.
3. **Tune the 4th String**: Lower the D string down to B.
4. **Tune the 3rd String**: Lower the G string down to E.
5. **Tune the 2nd String**: Lower the B string down to G#.
6. **Tune the 1st String**: Lower the high E string down to C#.

- The lower tuning decreases string tension, which may require heavier gauge strings to maintain proper tension and playability.
- Lower tunings can affect the neck tension, so a truss rod adjustment may be necessary to maintain proper neck relief.
- You may need to adjust the intonation of the guitar to ensure it stays in tune along the fretboard.


## Notes

In Western music, there are 12 unique notes within an octave. These notes are:

1. A
2. A# (A sharp) / Bb (B flat)
3. B
4. C
5. C# (C sharp) / Db (D flat)
6. D
7. D# (D sharp) / Eb (E flat)
8. E
9. F
10. F# (F sharp) / Gb (G flat)
11. G
12. G# (G sharp) / Ab (A flat)

### Explanation:
- **Natural Notes**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- **Sharp/Flat Notes**: Notes that have two names (enharmonic equivalents), such as A# and Bb, which represent the same pitch.
  
These 12 notes repeat in higher or lower octaves. For example, after G#, the next note would be A, but an octave higher.
