# Grafana

Open Source interactive data-visualization platform that allows users to see their data via charts + graphs on 1 unified dashboard.

Can also query the data and set alerts based on the metrics coming in.

Frequently paired with Prometheus to grab relevant metrics data from your EC2 or K8s instances, and then visualize them in Grafana.

Has `.json` files that are used to build & re-create your dashboards so the format of them can be shared or exported around (but obviously not the data).
