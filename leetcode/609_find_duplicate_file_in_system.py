# Given a list paths of directory info, including the directory path, and all the files
# with contents in this directory, return all the duplicate files in the file system in
# terms of their paths. You may return the answer in any order.

# A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have the same content.

# A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:

# "root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)"
# It means there are n files (f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt) with content
# (f1_content, f2_conten ... fn_content) respectively in the directory "root/d1/d2/.../dm".
# Note that n >= 1 and m >= 0. If m = 0, it means the directory is just the root directory.

# The output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all
# the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has
# the following format:

# "directory_path/file_name.txt"
